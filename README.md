Determine most important factors contributing to cervical cancer

This is an analysis of a dataset of 857 women with and without cervical cancer from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This is a 35-parameter dataset which includes age, number of sexual partners, number of pregnancies, as well as information on STDs, contraceptives, and smoking habits. I used forward selection to find the most important predictors, as well as principal component analysis, to create a logistic regression model classifying whether a patient has or does not have cervical cancer.
